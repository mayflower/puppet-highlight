puppet-highlight
================

This repo provides a basic configuration to get syntax highlighting in PHPStorm (_4.*_) for puppet files.

Installation
===============

Run `php parser.php` and put the output file (_Puppet files.xml_) into _<USER>\\.WebIde40\\config\\filetypes_ (or _~/Library/Preferences/WebIde40/filetypes_ for mac and _~/.WebIde40/config/filetypes_ if you use storm on a linux).
